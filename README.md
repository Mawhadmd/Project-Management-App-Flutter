# Project Management App

This was the final mobile project for my mobile course at university. I used flutter, supabase to create it and it is simple. 

## Main Features

- Add/remove/edit projects
- Add/remove/edit subtasks for the project
- Send a Friend request and add friends
- Assign friends to each subtask (Was planned)
- That's it, I know it's easy AF compared to what I built myself
